To control the robot, the irobot_create library needs to know how to talk to it. The port /dev/ttyUSB0 is hardcoded into the library's constructor. You can override this through the IROBOT_CREATE_PORT environment variable:

from bash:

IROBOT_CREATE_PORT=/dev/ttyS0 ./print_encoders

or you can set it permanently for your session:

export IROBOT_CREATE_PORT=/dev/ttyS0
./print_encoders
./drive_in_circle

or you can put that "export" line in your ~/.bashrc (~/.bash_profile or something similar on OS X) so it is automatically set when your shell starts.
